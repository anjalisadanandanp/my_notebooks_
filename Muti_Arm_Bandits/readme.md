# MULTI-ARM BANDIT PROBLEM

## Introduction
The multi-arm bandit problem is a classic problem in reinforcement learning. The problem is as follows: you are faced with a row of slot machines, each with an unknown probability of winning. You have a limited number of pulls, and your goal is to maximize your winnings. The multi-arm bandit problem is a trade-off between exploration and exploitation. You want to explore the different slot machines to learn which one has the highest probability of winning, but you also want to exploit the best slot machine to maximize your winnings.
